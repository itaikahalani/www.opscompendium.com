# The Ops Compendium

The Ops Compendium is your central hub for learning all things Ops—covering areas like MLOps, DataOps, and DevOps. It’s similar to the [Deep Learning & Machine Learning Compendium](https://www.mlcompendium.com/) and is designed as an educational resource. Through it, I aim to help people learn and connect with the amazing authors whose work I’ve summarized, quoted, and referenced.

The Ops Compendium is a fully open project on [GitHub](https://github.com/orico/www.opscompendium.com) (please star it!).&#x20;

I am committed to education and knowledge sharing, ensuring that this compendium remains not-for-profit and freely accessible. I envision it as a go-to resource for individuals at all skill levels—industry professionals, data engineers, machine learning engineers, DevOps practitioners, data scientists, and academics alike. This compendium is designed to save you countless hours of searching and filtering through articles of uncertain value, while also connecting you with exceptional authors whose work you can further support.

Please note that this is an ongoing project covering a wide range of topics. If you think something needs improvement or updates, you can easily contribute via [GitHub](https://github.com/orico/www.opscompendium.com) or [reach out to](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohenori/) me directly.

Many Thanks, \
Dr. Ori Cohen&#x20;
